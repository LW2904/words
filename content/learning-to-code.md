This is my take at attempting to convey the usefulness and beauty of programming to those new to the craft.

Here, you will have the opportunity to learn about some of the basics of software development using __JavaScript__ (or JS for short) through studying __working code of practical relevance__. It is very much a __personal document__, as everyone absords and assimilates knowledge differently, but I don't feel like that should stop me from writing it down.

>JavaScriptÂ® (often shortened to JS) is a lightweight, interpreted, object-oriented language with first-class functions, and is best known as the scripting language for Web pages, but it's used in many non-browser environments as well. It is a prototype-based, multi-paradigm scripting language that is dynamic, and supports object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.
